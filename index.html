          My name is Julia Vizca√≠no Luna, I am currently enrolled at Base Camp
          Coding Academy Graduate Institute in Water Valley, MS. Base Camp
          Coding Academy is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization that allows
          under-advantaged individuals to enroll in a year-long program where
          the students work with real-world technologies. These technologies
          include the fundamentals of app-development, coding, project
          management, and the life leadership skills we will need to be
          successful in our careers and competitive in this software development
          job market upon graduation. It is a fast-paced and focused curriculum
          that covers Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Django, Java, and Spring.
          Here I have become proficient in developing and learning new skills
          quickly. After graduating I will be equipped with a diverse and
          promising skill-set in coding. I graduated from The University of
          Mississippi with an Art Degree and am a skilled Graphic Design Artist.
          I think of coding as an art and enjoy the creativity that it brings.
          I'm excited to utilize all my skills both as an artist and a software
          developer. I equally enjoy both the front and back end of development.
          I have worked many years in the hospitality service industry, where I
          have picked up leadership and management skills. I am a team player
          and know I will make a great addition to any team.
